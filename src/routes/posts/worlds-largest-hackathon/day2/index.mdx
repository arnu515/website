I opened up my email to see that an AI support agent replied back, asking me to use
a Chromium-based browser. So I downloaded ungoogled-chromium and re-ran the stupid
prompt again this time frfr. After another 50K tokens, we got the same vite error.

`bolt` did generously ask if it wanted me to attempt to fix it, and it ate up 20K
tokens trying to run `npm install`; and still left me with another error, this time
claming that `../app.css` was not found. And indeed it wasn't, in fact, there was
not a single CSS file in the project.

I didn't want to waste any more tokens, so I copied an `app.css` file from one of my
other projects that used [shadcn-svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com).

This is what it came up with:

![The landing page that `bolt` designed](./img/day2-1.png)

Apart from the obvious contrast issues (which may have happened because of a missing
`app.css`), the rest of the page looks awesome!

Here's how it looks in light mode:

![The landing page that `bolt` designed, in light mode](./img/day2-2.png)

There are a few other issues that I found, like the Navbar not having a background,
so text below it would still be visible, and I'd have liked `bolt` using more of
that "glassy" design in other places too.

For now, that can wait, because I want to see what `bolt` had generated yesterday.

# Unboxing yesterday's lost memory

Let's take a look at what we might have possibly missed out on. I had downloaded
the project generated by `bolt` yesterday.

Running `bun install` gave me a few alarm bells:

All the dependencies are **major** versions behind! We're also using Svelte 4, and
not Svelte 5, so I'll probably have to migrate all that code myself, which *sucks*.

Anyway, let's see how this one looks:

![A screenshot of the landing page generated by `bolt` yesterday](./img/day2-old-1.png)

Quite similar, but I did like this one a bit more. We'll certainly be using *some*
inspiration. This one actually came with an `app.css`, and putting that file in
today's project makes it look much better! It fixed the contrast issues and the
navbar's background. I should've asked `bolt` to create it for me, but half my
tokens for today have already been used. Every time I send a message, it eats up
20K tokens.

`bolt` also did *not* add integration with Supabase, so that's another thing I'll
have to do.

# Re-styling

I bit the bullet and asked `bolt` to regenerate the `app.css` file.

SIXTY THOUSAND tokens and FIVE HUNDRED lines of CSS later, we have:

# Let's work locally

I set up the GitHub and Supabase integration on `bolt`, which created a repository
and pushed the project there so I could take a better look on my machine.

The first thing I notice is that `bolt`, while having used SvelteKit, has used a
README that claims that the project was *not* built with SvelteKit, which was
pretty strange.

The next thing I noticed is that `bolt` **committed** the `.env` file which
contained Supabase keys, and it also committed SvelteKit's internal `.svelte-kit`
folder, both of which should not have been committed. I fixed those issues by
running the following commands:

```bash
# --cached removes the files from the `git` index, but not from your disk
$ git rm --cached -r .env .svelte-kit/

$ echo -e "\n.env\n.svelte-kit/\n" >> .gitignore

$ git add .

$ git commit --amend

$ git push --force
```

This again shows that you should be very careful with AI, and double-check all the
code it produces.

I fixed a few other issues I found, like an invalid tsconfig, some broken styles,
and I bumped the dependencies and pushed the code to GitHub, from where `bolt`
automatically pulls whenever there are any changes.

I was too lazy to manually fix broken peerdeps, so I nuked the `package-lock.json`
and installed the latest version of every dependency using `npm i`. I've been using
`bun` and `pnpm` to manage dependencies for so long; using `npm` feels like a kick
to the guts. Unfortunately (from what I was able to find online anyway), `bolt`
(or Stackblitz rather) supports only `npm` for dependency resolution.

There were two major changes left to do now: Migrate from Svelte 4 to Svelte 5, and
migrate from Tailwind 3 to Tailwind 4. This is another bad side of AI. Since its
training data cuts off quite early, it isn't kept up to date on the latest versions
of packages, and it sucks to waste so much time migrating a brand new project.

I could have stuck with Svelte 4 and Tailwind 3, but that didn't bode well with me,
so oh boy, here we go!

And after two long hours, and changing a few more things, like the scrollbar styles,
I've finally migrated the application to Svelte 5 and Tailwind 4.

## Deploying on Netlify

I wanted to deploy the application to Netlify, so that I can get a free domain from
Entri. I clicked on the blue "Deploy" button in `bolt`, and it hung on
`npx vite build` for like 30 minutes. The build command did complete successfully,
but it wasn't exiting the process, instead, it was just hanging. The `build`
command did complete and exit successfully locally. Stackblitz uses a shell called
`jsh` to run commands on web containers, that's probably the thing causing the
issue.

Or maybe it was my fault for choosing SvelteKit instead of NextJS and React.

---

Well, after loads of debugging, including starting a blank SvelteKit project on
Stackblitz and adding dependencies one-by-one until I find out what breaks the
build, I see that it was upgrading to tailwind v4 that made the build command
hang indefinitely, irrespective of the adapter.

Well, so much for the time I spent on migration. It's time to rewrite git history
again!

That's about five hours (not all the time was spent on this application, mind you,
since I do get distracted quite easily) that I'll never get back.

I did test this on NextJS with Tailwind v4 on Stackblitz, and it built properly and
exited the build process, so I guess this issue affects only Vite unfortunately,
which quite sucks, because AFAIK, Stackblitz has been a big sponsor of Vite in the
past.

Anyway, after undoing hours of work (and creating one GitHub issue), we finally have
a deployed website, it should be live
[here](https://685038f5bb4956e0f3cc99c0--unique-cocada-4ed328.netlify.app/).

Unfortunately, I've stumbled onto a big problem. The TLD `.today` is not offered for
free on IONOS by Entri. I should have checked earlier, but for now I'll have to pick
another domain (and another name) for this project.
