Now it's time to add auth to the application! Supabase makes this
really easy to do through their `@supabase/ssr` SDK. You know what
makes this easier to do? Making `bolt` do it!

Now since this is auth code, it requires me to double, triple check
everything that `bolt` does, and I saw that, just like last time, it
used older versions of dependencies. I had to update `@supabase/ssr`
to the latest version and fix some deprecation warnings, but otherwise,
I'd say that `bolt` did quite a great job, especially for its cutoff
date.

`bolt` was really useful in making the login/signup UI forms. It also
made them look quite modern (when asked), so that's a plus too!

I implemented both email-password auth and github auth. For registration,
users create a profile and are sent an OTP via email, if they choose the
email option. Otherwise, profile data is pulled from their GitHub (by
Supabase).

## organised.today is now lovelyweb.site

I spent the rest of the day (and also most of yesterday) trying to think
of another name. I tried asking every AI agent out there to suggest other
names, but they would either suggest names that are already taken, names
that would cost a fortune, or just straight up garbage.

I gave up and started searching for random domain names. One of those
included lovelyweb.site, and I saw that it wasn't taken. It'd be really
funny if someone has that email address, y'know things like
`my@lovelyweb.site`. If I wasn't able to think of anything else, this
would certainly be it.

**Update:** This is it! Welcome to lovelyweb.site!
