I spent the most of this day implementing (and making `bolt` design)
the dashboard of the app. I took inspiration from Notion's dashboard,
with its sidebar and home page showing recent notes.

I asked `bolt` to replicate it, but using this application's design,
and it most certainly did a good job! I also included a bunch of
components from `shadcn-svelte` so that bolt would use those from
now on instead of writing its own styles for `<input>`s and things.

Then I fixed small bugs in the UI, stuff like the search icon for an
input being drawn below the input, hover backgrounds being way too
light on light mode, etc.

I also made `bolt` make the dashboard mobile-responsive, by auto-hiding
the sidebar and adding a menu toggle for it.

Finally, I asked `bolt` to make the email inbox UI with mock data and
buttons for selecting mails, deleting them, archiving them, etc.
